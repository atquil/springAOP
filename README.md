# Spring AOP

## What is happening

In Spring AOP, an @Aspect is a class that modularizes cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, or validation. Within an aspect, we define pointcuts to specify where the logic should apply—this could be at the class level, method level, or based on annotations (e.g., @Scheduled, @Transactional, or custom ones like @MyCustomValidation). Once a pointcut matches a join point—which is essentially a specific execution point in the application such as a method call, constructor invocation, or even field access—the corresponding advice determines what action to take. Spring supports multiple advice types: @Before runs before the method, @After runs after completion, @AfterReturning handles successful returns, @AfterThrowing intercepts exceptions, and @Around wraps the method entirely—allowing pre-checks, post-processing, or even blocking execution (ideal for security filters). Advice can either reference a reusable pointcut method or embed the pointcut expression directly. This separation of concerns makes Spring AOP a powerful tool for injecting behaviour without cluttering business logic.<img width="480" height="185" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b8ca3ed-6706-4928-ad07-ee82d3679798" />
